# 🔒 Steve Authentication Update Complete!

Steve has been updated to only appear after users log in for better security and user experience.

## ✅ Changes Made

### 🔐 Authentication Logic
- **ChatbotWrapper Component**: New component that checks authentication status
- **Login Detection**: Steve only appears when user has valid `authToken` and `user` data
- **Route Protection**: Steve is hidden on the `/login` page
- **Dynamic Updates**: Authentication status updates in real-time

### 🛡️ Security Features
- **Protected Access**: Only authenticated users can access Steve
- **Session Persistence**: Steve remembers authentication between browser sessions
- **Multi-tab Sync**: Authentication changes sync across browser tabs
- **Automatic Hiding**: Steve disappears immediately when users log out

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### Before Login
- ❌ Steve's floating button is **hidden**
- ❌ No chat functionality available
- ✅ Clean login page without distractions

### After Login
- ✅ Steve's floating button **appears** in bottom-left corner
- ✅ Full chat functionality available
- ✅ Context-aware health assistance

## 🧪 Testing the Update

1. **Visit the app**: http://localhost:3000
2. **Check login page**: Steve should be hidden
3. **Log in**: Use demo credentials:
   - Email: `demo@afyaquest.com`

4. **Verify Steve appears**: Look for floating button after login
5. **Test logout**: Steve should disappear when logged out
